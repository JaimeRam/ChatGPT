### 1. **Extracting Specific Data Points**

#### **Input Prompt:**
"Can you extract the fund names and their respective CAGR 1M from the image I provided?"

#### **ChatGPT Output:**
- Groupama Trésorerie IC: 4.17%
- La Française Trésorerie ISR R: 4.06%
- AXA Trésor Court Terme C: 3.80%

This extraction helps quickly identify the funds and their short-term compounded annual growth rates.

### 2. **Identifying Best Performing Investments**

#### **Input Prompt:**
"Based on the image, which funds have the highest CAGR 1M and lowest TER?"

#### **ChatGPT Output:**
The fund with the highest CAGR 1M and lowest TER is Groupama Trésorerie IC with a CAGR of 4.17% and a TER of 0.10%. This indicates a potentially attractive short-term investment opportunity due to its lower cost and higher growth rate.

### 3. **Generating Visualizations**

#### **Input Prompt:**
"Can you generate a graph comparing the CAGR 1M and TER of all funds listed in the image?"

#### **ChatGPT Output:**
To generate this graph, I would plot each fund on a scatter plot with CAGR 1M on the x-axis and TER on the y-axis. This visualization will help you quickly discern the relationship between the cost of the fund and its short-term growth performance.

### 4. **Comparative Analysis**

#### **Input Prompt:**
"Compare the performance and costs of funds focusing on liquidity from the image."

#### **ChatGPT Output:**
- **BlackRock ICS Euro Liquidity Fund Select Acc EUR** has a moderate performance with a CAGR 1M of 3.71% and a TER of 0.20%.
- **Amundi Euro Liquidity SRI IC C** shows a slightly higher growth at a CAGR 1M of 3.93% with a lower TER of 0.11%.

This comparative analysis provides a clear picture of how liquidity-focused funds stack up against each other in terms of cost and performance.

### 5. **Projected Loss Analysis**

#### **Input Prompt:**
"Calculate the projected maximum loss for each fund based on the provided maximum loss formula in the image."

#### **ChatGPT Output:**
To calculate the projected maximum loss for each fund, I will apply the formula as described in the image. For example, for BlackRock ICS Euro Liquidity Fund Select Acc EUR:
- Maximum Loss = Net Asset Value * Decimal Participation * Maximum Loss Per Transfer.

This calculation will be individually done for each fund to provide a risk assessment metric.

### Conclusion
By utilizing ChatGPT for these operations, you can significantly enhance your financial analysis, enabling quicker decision-making and deeper insights into investment opportunities. These functions can be performed either directly through text-based data extraction or by integrating Python scripts to automate calculations and generate visual data representations.
